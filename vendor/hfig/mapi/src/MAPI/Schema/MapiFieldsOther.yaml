# this file provides for the mapping of the keys of named properties
# to symbolic names (as opposed to mapitags.yaml, which is currently
# in a different format, has a different source, and is only fixed
# code properties)
#
# essentially the symbols are slightly munged versions of the names
# given to these properties by CDO, or Outlook's object model.
# it was parsed out of cdo10.htm, and neatened up a bit.
#
# interestingly, despite having separate guids, the codes are picked not to
# clash. further the names themselves have only 3 clashes in all the below.
